  - Solana wallets are generated by converting mnemonic to seed (BIP39) and deriving HD path (BIP44) to create keypairs via NaCl, encoding private key in Base58
  - Wallets (public/private keys, mnemonic) are shown for 60 seconds, then removed, with events logged to the backend 
  - If user sends assets to friend in Telegram who has no wallet app yet - [escrow smart contract in Rust](https://github.com/ctrlsa/instant-send-program) is set up for later redemption of assets
